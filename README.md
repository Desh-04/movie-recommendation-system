Movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques

# Movie Recommendation System 🎬

## Project Overview
This project builds a movie recommendation system using user ratings data.
The goal is to suggest relevant movies based on user preferences by applying
data analysis and machine learning techniques.

---

## Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
- **movies.csv** – movie titles and genres
- **ratings.csv** – user ratings for movies

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Approach
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature preparation for recommendation
- Similarity-based recommendation logic
- Movie recommendation generation

---

## Results
The system successfully recommends movies based on similarity and user
rating patterns, demonstrating the core concepts behind recommendation
systems used by real-world platforms.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to
build a basic recommendation system and highlights the importance of data
preprocessing and similarity modeling.
